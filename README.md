# Cryptocurrencies
####
An investment bank is wanting to get involved within the cryptocurrency market, but would like a better understanding of the options on the market to provide the best portfolio as possible to customers. The bank would like to offer several portfolio options of tradable cryptocurrency on the market, but is unsure of where to start. In this analysis, an unsupervised machine learning model, Python, and Pandas are used as the data is unfamiliar to the bank. With this machine learning method, a clustering algorithm is utilized to show the bank how the cryptocurrency currently groups together based on the raw data. Once the methods have been decided upon, the data is preprocessed to ensure only tradable cryptocurrency is being looked at before going through the PCA process to create data for the primary components. From there, a k-means model is used to cluster the cryptocurrencies together which allows for the visual representation of the data at the end of the Jupyter Notebook file.
